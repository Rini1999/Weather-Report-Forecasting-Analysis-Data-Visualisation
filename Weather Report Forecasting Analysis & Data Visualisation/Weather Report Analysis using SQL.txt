**SQl Queries**
--Query No-1 Give the count of the minimum number of days for the time when temperature reduced.
with cte as (
	    select Date,Temperature,
	    lag(Temperature) over(order by Date) as prev_temp
	     from Final_df1)
select count (*) as min_days
from cte
where Temperature < prev_temp;


--Query No-2 Find the temperature as Cold / hot by using the case and avg of values of the given data set
with cte as (
	     select Date,Temperature from Final_df1)
	      select Date,Temperature,
        case 
	when Temperature >=AVG(Temperature) over() then 'Hot'
		else 'Cold'
	end as Temp_status
from cte;


--Query No-3 Can you check for all 4 consecutive days when the temperature was below 30 Fahrenheit
with cte as (
	     select Date,Temperature,
	     case when temperature < 30 then 'below'
	     else 'above'
	     end as temp,
	     ROW_NUMBER() over(order by Date) as rn
	     from Final_df1)
select cte.Date,cte.Temperature,cte.temp
from cte
where temp = 'below'
	and(select count (*)
	from cte as inner_cte
	where inner_cte.rn between cte.rn and cte.rn+3 and inner_cte.temp = 'below') = 4
	order by cte.Date


--Query No-4  Can you find the maximum number of days for which temperature dropped.
with cte as (
                   select count(Date) as count_no
                    from Final_df1
                    group by Temperature
                    Having Temperature < avg(Temperature))
select sum(count_no) as Total_days
from cte


--Query No-5 Can you find the average of average humidity from the dataset  ( NOTE: should contain the following clauses: group by, order by, date )

select Date, avg(AVG_Humidity) from 
                           (select Date, AVG_Humidity
                            from Final_df1) a
group by Date
order by Date


-- Query No-6 Use the GROUP BY clause on the Date column and make a query to fetch details for average windspeed
select date,AVG_windspeed
from Final_df1
group by Date,AVG_windspeed;

--Query No 7 Please add the data in the dataset for 2034 and 2035 as well as forecast predictions for these years 

--Query No 8 If the maximum gust speed increases from 55mph, fetch the details for the next 4 days


--Query No-9
select COUNT(Date) as low_temp_days
from Final_df1
where Temperature < 0;


--Query No-10   Create another table with a “Foreign key” relation with the existing given data set.
